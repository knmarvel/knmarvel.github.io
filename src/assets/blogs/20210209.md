# Day 2: CSS time

**"I like to futureproof things"**, I said to myself over and over again last night, making components stupidly complicated when my end goal was to put one blog post on my website. I've realized a few things: 

    * YAGNI -- as my [Kenzie](https://kenzie.academy) would say about future proofing, "YA AIN'T GONNA NEED IT". Likely, I won't use this site for more than practice. And if I do, I can change things up later.

    * THANKS CRIPPLING PERFECTIONISM FOR WASTING MY TIME. I often make goals so lofty that I fail before I start.

    * EDITING IS GOOD, but it needs to come after writing--the creative part of the brain is stifled by nitpicking. As Ernest Hemingway didn't say but everyone likes to say he said, "Write drunk, edit sober." I need to let the code flow. 


## TODAY'S GOALS

* Style the blog landing and blog short post
* Stretch goal: style the blog detail page
* Stretch Armstrong goal: fix my projects, tech stack, and resume pages because they got borked hard in the last few commits.


## TODAY'S CHANGELOG

* BlogLanding component:
    * Removed blog placeholder text.
    * Added blog landing CSS file and imported it.
    * Imported [react-spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners) library so if my blog doesn't immediately load, we've still got something visually interesting on the page.
    * [UUID for the keys](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uuid)
    * Make the BlogPostShort look like a card

### RANDOM THINGS I LEARNED!

* GitHub Pages is persnickety. My previous set up followed the [react-gh-pages tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) and worked great. Last night, it did not work at all. Switched to [Vercel](https://www.vercel.com) for deployment until I'm less angry at Github pages and willing to troubleshoot.
